# dice-roller
A toy dice roller, written in NodeJS, using Express.

## Motivation
While looking at potential new career opportunities, I noticed a goodly number that were asking for NodeJS and Express. Since I've built my career on learning new things to adapt to new opportunities, I wanted to get a quick understanding of what is involved in Express. Previously, I had only used NodeJS for one-off modules and AWS Lambda functions, but had never touched Express. After some quick reading, I felt I wanted to build a toy application to see how I could build something practical (if frivolous).

## Installation
Assuming NodeJS is already properly installed:

1. npm install.
2. npm start.
3. Access localhost:3000
